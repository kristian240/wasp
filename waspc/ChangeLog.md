# Changelog


## v0.5.0.0 (2022/05/18)

### [NEW FEATURE] Wasp now has support for running Jobs!

If you have server tasks that you do not want to handle as part of the normal request-response cycle, now Wasp allows you to make that function a Job and it will gain some "superpowers"!

Jobs will persist between server restarts, can be retried if they fail, and they can even be delayed until the future (or have a recurring schedule)!

Some examples where you may want to use a Job on the server include sending an email, making an HTTP request to some external API, or doing some nightly calculations.

To run Jobs, you don't need any additional infrastructure at the moment, just a Postgre database that you anyway need to deploy Wasp to production.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Wasp now requires latest LTS version of NodeJS
  - We had a bit of issues with being too relaxed on the version of NodeJS that can be used with Wasp so we thightened it up a bit.
    We also added a more thorough check in Wasp for it, that will warn you very explicitely if you are using the wrong version of Node.
- Updated react-query to v3
  - This brings some new features from react query while also laying the foundation for the further features we are building on top of it in Wasp (coming soon!).
- Updated python to python3 in Dockerfile generated upon `wasp build`.

### Various improvements

- Finally fixed a bug with orphaned processes in development.
- Various other bug fixes, doc improvements, and refactorings.

## v0.4.0.0 (2022/02/23)

### [BREAKING CHANGE] Upgrading Prisma to version 3.9.1

We are happy to announce Wasp is now using a much newer version of Prisma! This change does not impact the Wasp DSL support for Prisma, but it does come with some caveats from Prisma based on your usage. Please see this note for any breaking changes: https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-3

*Note: When you first migrate after upgrading, you will likely see a new migration created for 3.x specific features related to updating foreign keys and indexes.*

### Various improvements

- Automatically regenerating your Prisma client, as needed, based on your Prisma schema changes.
- Tracking your NPM project dependency changes and automatically invoking `npm install`, as needed, so you are always up to date.
- and more!

## v0.3.0.0 (2022/02/04)

### [BREAKING CHANGE] New Wasp-lang syntax!

Mostly it is very similar to what it was before, with some following bigger changes:
  - `auth`, `dependencies`, and couple of other "singleton" delcarations now became part of `app` declaration.
  - All declarations now need to have name, including `route`.
  - `route` has different syntax.
  - `dependencies` have different syntax.

For exact details about new syntax, check https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/language/syntax .

### Various improvements

  - Better compiler error messages.
  - Nicer CLI output.
  - Added delay on recompilation to avoid redundant recompiling.
  - Added `onAuthSucceededRedirectTo` field in `app`.
  - and more!
